=============

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/frapposelli/vagrant-vcloud](https://badges.gitter.im/frapposelli/vagrant-vcloud.svg)](https://gitter.im/frapposelli/vagrant-vcloud?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Please note that this software is still Alpha/Beta quality and is not recommended for production usage.

We have a wide array of boxes available at [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/gosddc) you can use them directly or you can roll your own as you please, make sure to install VMware tools in it.

Starting from [version 0.4.2](../../releases/tag/v0.4.2), this plugin supports the universal [```vmware_ovf``` box format](https://github.com/gosddc/packer-post-processor-vagrant-vmware-ovf/wiki/vmware_ovf-Box-Format), that is 100% portable between [vagrant-vcloud](https://github.com/frapposelli/vagrant-vcloud), [vagrant-vcenter](https://github.com/gosddc/vagrant-vcenter) and [vagrant-vcloudair](https://github.com/gosddc/vagrant-vcloudair), no more double boxes!.

If you're unsure about what are the correct network settings for your Vagrantfile make sure to check out the [Network Deployment Options](https://github.com/frapposelli/vagrant-vcloud/wiki/Network-Deployment-Options) wiki page.

Check the full releases changelog [here](../../releases)

Install
-------------

Latest version can be easily installed by running the following command:

```vagrant plugin install vagrant-vcloud```

Vagrant will download all the required gems during the installation process.

After the install has completed a ```vagrant up --provider=vcloud``` will trigger the newly installed provider.

Upgrade
-------------

If you already have vagrant-vcloud installed you can update to the latest version available by issuing:

```vagrant plugin update vagrant-vcloud```

Vagrant will take care of the upgrade process.

Configuration
-------------

Here's a sample Multi-VM Vagrantfile, please note that ```vcloud.vdc_edge_gateway``` and ```vcloud.vdc_edge_gateway_ip``` are required only when you cannot access ```vcloud.vdc_network_name``` directly and there's an Organization Edge between your workstation and the vCloud Network.

```ruby
nodes = [
  { hostname: 'web-vm', box: 'gosddc/precise32' },
  { hostname: 'ssh-vm', box: 'gosddc/precise32' },
  { hostname: 'sql-vm', box: 'gosddc/precise32' },
  { hostname: 'app-vm', box: 'gosddc/precise32' }
]

Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|

  # vCloud Director provider settings
  config.vm.provider :vcloud do |vcloud|
    vcloud.vapp_prefix = 'multibox-sample'

    vcloud.hostname = 'https://my.cloudprovider.com'
    vcloud.username = 'MyUserName'
    vcloud.password = 'MySup3rS3cr3tPassw0rd!'

    vcloud.org_name = 'OrganizationName'
    vcloud.vdc_name = 'vDC_Name'

    vcloud.catalog_name = 'Vagrant'
    vcloud.ip_subnet = '172.16.32.125/255.255.255.240'

    vcloud.vdc_network_name = 'MyNetwork'

    vcloud.vdc_edge_gateway = 'MyOrgEdgeGateway'
    vcloud.vdc_edge_gateway_ip = '10.10.10.10'
  end

  nodes.each do |node|
    config.vm.define node[:hostname] do |node_config|
      node_config.vm.box = node[:box]
      node_config.vm.hostname = node[:hostname]
      node_config.vm.box_url = node[:box_url]
      node_config.vm.network :forwarded_port,
                             guest: 80,
                             host: 8080,
                             auto_correct: true
      # node_config.vm.provision :puppet do |puppet|
      #   puppet.manifests_path = 'puppet/manifests'
      #   puppet.manifest_file = 'site.pp'
      #   puppet.module_path = 'puppet/modules'
      # end
    end
  end
end
```

What is still missing:

- TEST SUITES! (working on that).
- Speed, the code is definitely not optimized.
- Permission checks, make sure you have at least Catalog Admin privileges if you want to upload boxes to vCloud.
- Thorough testing.
- Error checking is absymal.
- Some spaghetti code here and there.
- Bugs, bugs and BUGS!.
